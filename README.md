# Ruby Travel Bucket List Solo Project

I was given the following brief:

_Travel Bucket List
Build an app to track someoneâ€™s travel adventures._

_MVP:
The app should allow the user to track countries and cities they want to visit and those they have visited.
The user should be able to create and edit countries
Each country should have one or more cities to visit
The user should be able to create and delete entries for cities
The app should allow the user to mark destinations as visited or still to see_

_Possible Extensions:
Have separate pages for destinations visited and those still to visit
Add sights to the destination cities
Search for destination by continent, city or country
Any other ideas you might come up with_

I was able to complete the MVP successfully. In terms of the extensions I was able to create the visited and planned destination pages, along with searching for destinations by name.

I was also able to add an additional extension of a welcome page to the user which displays the most most recently added planned destinations and the destinations that the user has most recently indicated to have visited.


I fulfilled this brief as a solo project.
